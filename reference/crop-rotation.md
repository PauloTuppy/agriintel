# Crop Rotation & Agronomy Rules

## Rotation Constraints
- **Never recommend** the same crop two seasons in a row unless explicitly marked as "Monoculture Tolerant" (e.g., some perennial grasses).
- **Legume Benefit**: If previous crop was a legume (beans, peas, soy), boost nitrogen availability for next crop (reduce fertilizer cost estimate by 10%).
- **Disease Cycles**: Avoid repeating crops from the same family (e.g., Solanaceae: tomato, potato, pepper) within 3 years.

## Soil & Climate Matching
- **Soil Type**:
  - Sandy: Good for root crops, needs irrigation.
  - Clay: Good for grains, water retention issues.
  - Loam: Ideal for most crops.
- **Climate Zone**:
  - Ensure crop hardiness zone matches user's region.
