# Logistics & Buyer Rules

## Route Optimization
- **Cost Calculation**: Total Cost = (Distance * Cost_Per_Km) + Handling_Fees.
- **Perishability**:
  - High perishability (berries, leafy greens): Max transit time < 24 hours.
  - Medium perishability (tomatoes, peppers): Max transit time < 72 hours.
  - Low perishability (grains, root veg): Cost is primary factor over time.

## Buyer Selection
- **Reliability Score**: Prefer buyers with > 4.5/5 rating for high-value crops.
- **Volume Matching**: Ensure buyer's minimum order quantity (MOQ) is met by farmer's projected yield.
